So
much
happy
ending
Let
talk
It
like
dead
Was
something
I
Was
something
You
said
Don
leave
hanging
In
city
dead
Held
high
On
breakable
thread
You
things
I
thought
I
knew
And
I
thought
could
You
everything
everything
I
wanted
We
meant
supposed
lost
And
memories
close
fade
away
All
time
pretending
So
much
happy
ending
You
got
dumb
friends
I
know
say
They
tell
I
difficult
But
But
know
Do
even
know
All
things
hide
All
shit
You
things
I
thought
I
knew
And
I
thought
could
It
nice
know
Thanks
acting
like
cared
And
making
feel
like
I
one
It
nice
know
Thanks
watching
I
fall
And
letting
know
done
So
much
happy
ending
