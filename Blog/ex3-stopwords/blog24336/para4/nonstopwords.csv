I
smell
The
scent
reminiscent
powder
Not
baby
powder
dry
mute
aroma
A
floral
accent
present
similar
lilacs
yet
pungent
Before
I
one
visual
The
setting
always
Nighttime
turns
red
grey
yellow
white
She
stands
softly
back
wall
windows
covered
mostly
draperies
It
seems
bedroom
The
visual
strongest
Long
straight
hair
frames
oval
face
giving
intelligent
air
The
color
black
understatement
raven
hair
dark
translucent
The
contrast
pale
skin
remarkable
Though
barely
visible
moonlight
eyes
burn
comfortable
evil
She
definitely
equal
Her
attire
still
bit
hazy
The
Japanese
aspects
psyche
scream
kimono
yet
could
simple
shapeless
dress
wearing
The
setting
speaks
home
night
could
gotten
home
There
many
things
I
know
yet
questions
still
remain
Her
emotion
toward
two
possibilities
either
upset
concerned
something
us
joy
heart
boundless
The
year
I
turn
22
pivotal
meet
year
get
married
year
These
images
soothsay
swirl
mind
mist
never
grasped
