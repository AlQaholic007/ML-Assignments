urlLink
Slickdeals
last
week
I
finally
got
around
putting
old
30
GB
drive
fireball
The
problems
started
Since
30
GB
drive
already
desktop
I
decided
install
OpenBSD
3
4
drive
transferring
server
That
install
went
smoothly
drive
would
boot
I
transferred
I
figured
like
transfer
I
reinstalled
OpenBSD
fireball
When
I
tried
boot
second
install
bootloader
would
come
crap
like
After
45
minutes
playing
around
bootloader
BIOS
boot
sequence
I
finally
figured
boot
unless
drive
primary
IDE
chain
Ok
finally
got
new
drive
running
When
installing
OBSD
first
steps
install
ports
tree
tcsh
vim
source
add
mbibik
user
I
got
far
compiling
tcsh
static
machine
froze
hard
I
figured
whatever
random
lockup
Nope
anytime
I
taxed
processor
machine
would
freeze
Obviously
least
seemed
like
heat
issue
I
opened
case
check
CPU
fan
fairly
small
AKA
cramped
case
I
see
fan
behind
power
supply
I
monitored
CPU
temp
never
seemed
get
dangerous
territory
I
gave
point
told
Russell
internet
would
awhile
server
NAT
internet
I
started
play
much
damned
thing
freezes
every
15
minutes
I
gave
trying
install
tcsh
vim
etc
started
surfing
net
desktop
Oddly
enough
lock
At
point
I
realized
interactive
activities
installing
compiling
probably
accessing
disk
using
box
router
would
access
disk
periodically
write
logs
I
switched
back
old
drive

Too
