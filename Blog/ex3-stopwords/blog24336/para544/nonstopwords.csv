Let
see
begin
First
interview
week
half
ago
I
divulge
much
information
two
reasons
1
I
gotten
yes
said
company
2
I
sign
NDA
I
could
talk
anyone
Let
see
many
details
I
give
away
without
giving
away
First
I
told
I
would
anywhere
three
five
interviews
total
There
ended
total
six
I
interpret
hopeful
sign
I
arrived
recruiting
building
yes
entire
building
devoted
recruiting
around
8
AM
end
leaving
around
6
PM
Given
half
hour
lunch
practically
nine
half
hours
interviewing
Second
riddles
asked
fairly
interesting
though
I
might
heard
I
never
solved
The
first
one
much
riddle
generic
design
question
I
asked
I
would
design
timing
given
traffic
light
I
allowed
request
whatever
information
desired
I
come
formulas
making
best
traffic
light
The
first
part
problem
define
best
What
makes
good
traffic
light
I
decided
combination
two
factors
1
Maximum
throughput
directions
2
Low
traffic
jam
incidence
rate
After
figuring
formula
single
intersection
I
modify
grid
intersections
Then
I
asked
think
outside
box
yes
phrase
used
exactly
figure
ways
improve
experience
All
basic
design
problem
The
second
riddle
programming
question
something
I
expect
encounter
since
I
interviewing
management
position
Managers
code
I
given
2D
array
figure
time
would
take
sort
I
barely
remembered
performance
numbers
different
sort
algorithms
I
remembered
quick
sort
O
n
log
n
thankfully
correct
Sorting
2D
array
would
thus
take
O
n
log
n
2
The
second
part
programming
question
sort
two
already
sorted
linked
lists
This
simple
since
setup
two
iterators
would
move
along
two
lists
removing
smaller
two
items
The
riddle
I
hardest
time
cube
desk
calendar
You
two
cubes
allowed
put
single
digit
face
With
two
cubes
represent
every
number
01
31
This
turned
difficult
I
realized
could
mathematically
approach
define
restrictions
Some
examples
restrictions
need
1
block
since
represent
11
The
thing
2
22
Eventually
I
got
point
I
six
open
spots
cubes
seven
numbers
put
cubes
This
I
realized
could
use
6
represent
9
thus
solved
puzzle
Almost
riddle
mathematic
basis
The
next
riddle
started
word
problem
A
man
starts
point
A
mountain
walks
point
B
exactly
12
hours
At
time
later
walks
point
B
point
A
exactly
12
hours
He
constant
rate
ascent
descent
The
actual
riddle
Can
prove
disprove
existence
point
P
man
took
amount
time
reach
spot
mountain
I
trouble
trying
prove
since
true
Eventually
I
given
hint
use
graph
First
I
tried
plotting
time
versus
distance
That
dumb
Once
I
plotted
time
versus
location
I
showed
plots
must
intersect
thus
point
P
exist
The
last
riddle
one
I
heard
long
long
time
ago
I
knew
answer
know
explain
first
This
Let
Make
Deal
riddle
You
three
doors
choose
1
prize
2
without
After
choose
door
host
show
eliminate
one
doors
choose
ask
pick
You
either
stick
original
door
choose
remaining
door
The
question
stay
switch
I
knew
supposed
switch
think
top
head
Finally
I
realized
initial
chance
winning
1
3
After
elimination
chance
least
2
3
Switching
smart
Ok
first
updates
I
gotta
run
though
