Basically
Joe

time
since
owned
He
played
rally
races
since
hates
races
pavement
Matt
scrapped
awhile
I
tossed
hat
ring
I
impression
correctly
navigate
turn
turning
whole
time
In
rally
farther
truth
You
turn
well
actual
bend
road
power
slide
almost
every
one
I
got
smoked
first
races
After
left
I
gave
course
runs
I
barely
beat
course
Easy
mode
I
figured
turning
Each
run
saw
times
improving
iteration
Eventually
I
beating
CPU
car
10
seconds
Hard
mode
That
I
got
hooked
GT3
extremely
deep
game
Even
simplistic
Arcade
mode
30
tracks
many
cars
count
The
simulation
mode
depth
I
quite
fathomed
yet
You
start
meager
amount
money
cars
My
first
car
whopping
116
HP
start
pretty
depressing
since
Zig

pushing

driving
licenses
allow
enter
difficult
races
obviously
race
I
started

hooked
On

For
reason
Zig
decided
programming
buddies
contest
He
write
basic
GUI
allows
people
plug
two
chess
engines
