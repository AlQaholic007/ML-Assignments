I
believe
George
Carlin
said
best
Here
problem
ten
commandments
exactly
10
You
simply
need
ten
The
list
ten
commandments
artificially
deliberately
inflated
get
ten
Here
happened
About
5
000
years
ago
bunch
religious
political
hustlers
got
together
try
figure
control
people
keep
line
They
knew
people
basically
stupid
would
believe
anything
told
announced
God
given
commandments
mountain
one
around
Well
let
ask
making
shit
pick
10
Why
9
11
I
tell
10
sound
official
Ten
sounds
important
Ten
basis
decimal
system
decade
psychologically
satisfying
number
top
ten
ten
wanted
ten
best
dressed
So
ten
commandments
really
marketing
decision
It
clearly
bullshit
list
It
political
document
artificially
inflated
sell
better
I
show
reduce
number
commandments
come
list
little
workable
logical
I
going
use
Roman
Catholic
version
ones
I
taught
little
boy
Let
start
first
three
I
AM
THE
LORD
THY
GOD
THOU
SHALT
NOT
HAVE
STRANGE
GODS
BEFORE
ME
THOU
SHALT
NOT
TAKE
THE
NAME
OF
THE
LORD
THY
GOD
IN
VAIN
THOU
SHALT
KEEP
HOLY
THE
SABBATH
Right
bat
first
three
pure
bullshit
Sabbath
day
Lord
name
strange
gods
Spooky
language
Designed
scare
control
primitive
people
In
way
superstitious
nonsense
like
apply
lives
intelligent
civilized
humans
21st
century
So
7
Next
HONOR
THY
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
Obedience
respect
authority
Just
another
name
controlling
people
The
truth
obedience
respect
automatic
They
earned
based
parent
performance
Some
parents
deserve
respect
period
You
six
Now
interest
logic
something
religion
uncomfortable
going
jump
around
list
little
bit
THOU
SHALT
NOT
STEAL
THOU
SHALT
NOT
BEAR
FALSE
WITNESS
Stealing
lying
Well
actually
two
prohibit
kind
behavior
dishonesty
So
really
need
two
combine
call
commandment
thou
shalt
dishonest
And
suddenly
5
And
long
combining
I
two
others
belong
together
THOU
SHALT
NOT
COMMIT
ADULTRY
THOU
SHALT
NOT
COVET
THY
NEIGHBOR
S
WIFE
Once
two
prohibit
type
behavior
In
case
marital
infidelity
The
difference
coveting
takes
place
mind
But
I
think
outlaw
fantasizing
someone
else
wife
guy
gonna
think
waxing
carrot
But
marital
infidelity
good
idea
gonna
keep
one
call
thou
shalt
unfaithful
And
suddenly
four
But
think
honesty
infidelity
really
part
overall
value
truth
could
combine
two
honesty
commandments
two
fidelity
commandments
give
simpler
language
positive
language
instead
negative
language
call
whole
thing
thou
shalt
always
honest
faithful
3
THOU
SHALT
NOT
COVET
THY
NEIGHBOR
S
GOODS
This
one
plain
fuckin
stupid
Coveting
neighbor
goods
keeps
economy
going
Your
neighbor
gets
vibrator
plays
come
ye
faithful
want
one
Coveting
creates
jobs
leave
alone
You
throw
coveting
2
big
honesty
fidelity
commandment
one
talked
yet
THOU
SHALT
NOT
KILL
Murder
But
think
religion
never
really
big
problem
murder
More
people
killed
name
god
reason
All
look
Northern
Ireland
Cashmire
Inquisition
Crusades
World
Trade
Center
see
seriously
religious
folks
take
thou
shalt
kill
The
devout
see
murder
negotiable
It
depends
doin
killin
gettin
killed
So
mind
I
give
revised
list
two
commandments
Thou
shalt
always
honest
faithful
provider
thy
nookie
Thou
shalt
try
real
hard
kill
anyone
unless
course
pray
different
invisible
man
Two

carried
hill
fuckin
pocket

courthouse
wall
long
provided

additional
commandment
Thou
shalt
keep
thy
religion
thyself
