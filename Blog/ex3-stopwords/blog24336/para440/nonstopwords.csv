A
new
project
I
would
like
work
A
simple
BSD
Linux
boot
disk
contains
utilities
testing
hacked
box
Initially
system
administrator
would
boot
floppy
run
initialization
utilitity
It
would
take
MD5
hash
files
specific
directories
etc
bin
sbin
usr
bin
store
results
text
file
Later
system
administrator
could
boot
floppy
run
comparison
utility
It
would
take
another
MD5
hash
files
compare
results
Doing
BSD
would
easier
I
access
many
BSD
machines
Doing
Linux
would
make
much
widely
supported
Can
stock
Linux
kernel
mount
FFS
file
systems
I
know
OpenBSD
mount
Ext2
file
systems
Red
Hat
uses
Ext3
default
would
work
older
RH
systems
Hopefully
I
able
create
boot
disk
would
work
unix
system
This
project
could
also
use
urlLink
Tripwire
urlLink
pre
made
system
disk
Or
maybe
I
scratch
jerk
