I
finally
got
MDE
project
We
run
large
image
processing
tasks
run
many
processors
We
developed
code
distribute
computations
several
Unix
systems
really
date
In
particular
need
take
advantage
compute
power
Linux
clusters
We
small
cluster
would
liek
exploit
capabilities
large
cluster
Center
Parallel
Computing
One
students
provided
following
request
I
think
would
make
great
senior
design
project
real
applicability
commercial
world
How
tool
set
running
background
C
code
MatLab
jobs
Kind
like
launch
program
use
local
Athlons
A
script
would
detect
machines
idle
launch
jobs
joblist
serially
Alternatively
even
better
could
get
account
Center
Parallel
Computing
Athlon
clusters
These
clusters
use
SMP
parallel
computing
additions
C
language
For
independent
C
processes
like
tracking
would
hard
write
scripts
modify
C
code
run
Athlon
clusters
maybe
even
automatically
launch
give
feedback
process
So
users
run
independent
C
code
systems
without
learn
SMP
additions
details
parallel
cluster
Automatic
transfer
files
without
interactive
authentication
big
little
endian
compensation
may
pose
challenges
This
seriously
developed
project
description
We
going
meeting
professor
suggested
project
get
solid
details
The
cool
part
professor
works
biomedical
engineering
department
My
bio
degree
make
easier
get
head
