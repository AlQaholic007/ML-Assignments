On
Tuesday
Jeff
decided
racquetball
30
minutes
cardio
lifting
I
hit

burning
400
calories
Lifting
directly
afterward
felt

difficult
Anytime

anyone
actually
want
hear
grunt
Last
night
Jeff

hit
gym
alone
Again
400
calories
elliptical
Many
people
commented
increased
size
I
assumed
musculature
far
since
people
say
Man
looking
little
pudgy
Mike
I
feel
added
muscle
mass
simply
pushing
existing
fat
farther
I
almost
tempted
scale
back
lifting
favor
cardio
I
making
progress
strength
I
added
least
25
pounds
bench
since
started
working
end
summer
Maybe
