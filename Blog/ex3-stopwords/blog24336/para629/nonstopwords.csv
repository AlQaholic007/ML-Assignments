When
I
first
read
article
I
thought
Great
So
many
people
love
feature
Now
I
really
think
much
use
really
going
get
Ever
since
cell
phones
became
popular
adding
new
phone
number
became
routine
occurance
It
big
deal
change
phone
number
I
could
skewed
viewpoint
almost
everyone
phone
number
also
email
address
Everytime
I
changed
phone
numbers
happened
every
year
college
I
moved
Washington
I
sent
email
announcing
change
It
could
much
difficult
people
alternate
form
communication
I
see
used
people
ran
business
line
home
They
keep
number
probably

tied
mobile
phone
Since
I
work
mobile
phone
industry
way
get
people
switch
fine
I
see
one
issue
ruling
though
Up
point
I
believe
telemarketers
relied
fact
cell
phones
landlines
completely
seperate
They
knew
extensions
mobile
operators
would
call
numbers
since
illegal
telemarket
cell
phone
since
costs
customer
money
Now
line
completely
removed
Is
going
national
database
cellular
versus
landlines
How
secure
would
