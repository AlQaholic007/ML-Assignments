I
another
project
add
list
Hopefully
I
finish
one
semester
For
sake
argument
I
define
lifespan
operating
system
day
released
public
either
purchase
download
time
two
new
versions
operating
system
come
An
example
would
urlLink
OpenBSD
2

It
released
June
1st
2001
Since
urlLink
OpenBSD
3
1
second
version
past
2

came
May
19th
2002
lifespan
OpenBSD

2002
Over
lifespan
OpenBSD
2
9
27
different
patches
That
might
seem
like
much
two
patches
month
For
company
many
servers
could
lot
patching
Likewise
current
version
OpenBSD
3
1
14
patches
already
That
version
available
three
months
last
patch
issued
Now
I
cleared
time
actual
project
An
OpenBSD
version
urlLink
Windows
Update
Since
self
respecting
BSD
admin
would
go
website
patches
BSDUpdate
would
command
line
tool
It
would
check
current
state
system
verify
patches
needed
download
The
tool
install
patches
restart
services
necessary
The
tool
could
also
put
automatic
mode
placed
cron
job
completely
seamless
updating
This
actually
easy
project
also
time
consuming
Nevertheless
I
damned
I
ever
finish
