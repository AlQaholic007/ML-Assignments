I
believe
I
forgot
post
So
every
three
months
urlLink
Puget
Sound
Blood
Center
sends
Bloodmobile
campus
I
made
appointment
first
time
came
around
cancel
due
meeting
conflict
The
second
time
came
around
I
went
donate
without
appointment
full
Finally
I
got
donate
yesterday
Since
first
time
donating
I
go
full
screening
process
mini
interview
Finally
I
give
blood
lay
extra
minutes
afterward
since
first
time
The
actual
process
giving
blood
went
fine
As
I
laying
resting
stomach
started
feel
bit
nauseous
Suddenly
nausea
got
worse
I
started
think
asking
one
nurses
something
vomit
The
next
thing
I
notice
three
people
crowded
around
I
got
cold
compresses
neck
chest
Turns
I
passed
I
seconds
pleasant
experience
Soon
I
woke
I
broke
cold
sweat
I
felt
functional
5
minutes
later
I
definitely
tired
rest
day
I
obviously
skipped
hockey
game
