Well
I
say
introduced
first
time
I

Instead

see
various
default
unique
folders
assign

With

supports
filters

hand

move
directly
trash
You
cannot
mark
anything
spam
filter
One
little
feature
I
saw
help
files
actually
implement
related
attachments
Instead
showing
common
generic
paper
clip
icon
denote
attachment
GMail
would
use
icon
represent
file
type
attachment
If
PDF
common
PDF
icon
would
used
etc
I
tested
paper

Shucky

Overall
I
sure
