Describe

One
student
replied
You
tie
long
piece
string
neck
barometer
lower
barometer
roof
skyscraper
ground
The
length
string
plus
length
barometer
equal
height
building
This
highly
original
answer
incensed
examiner
student
failed
immediately
The
student
appealed
grounds
answer
indisputably
correct
university
appointed
independent
arbiter
decide
case
The
arbiter
judged
answer
indeed
correct
display
noticeable
knowledge
physics
To
resolve
problem
decided
call
student
allow
six
minutes
provide
verbal
answer
showed
least
minimal
familiarity
basic
principles
physics
For
five
minutes
student
sat
silence
forehead
creased
thought
The
arbiter
reminded
time
running
student
replied
several
extremely
relevant
answers
make
mind
use
On
advised
hurry
student
replied
follows
Firstly
could
take
barometer
roof
skyscraper
drop
edge
measure
time
takes
reach
ground
The
height
building
worked
formula
H
0
5g
x
squared
But
bad
luck
barometer
Or
sun
shining
could
measure
height
barometer
set
end
measure
length
shadow
Then
measure
length
skyscraper
shadow
thereafter
simple
matter
proportional
arithmetic
work
height
skyscraper
But
wanted
highly
scientific
could
tie
short
piece
string
barometer
swing
like
pendulum
first
ground
level
roof
skyscraper
The
height
worked
difference
gravitational
restoring
force
T

pi
sqrroot
l
g
Or
skyscraper
outside
emergency
staircase
would
easier
walk
mark
height
skyscraper
barometer
lengths
add
If
merely
wanted
boring
orthodox
course
could
use
barometer
measure
air
pressure
roof
skyscraper
ground
convert
difference
millibars
feet
give
height
building
But
since
constantly
exhorted
exercise
independence
mind
apply
scientific
methods
undoubtedly
best
way
would
knock
janitor
door
say
If
would
like
nice
new
barometer
I
give
one
tell
height
skyscraper
