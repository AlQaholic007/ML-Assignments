If
could
change
one
thing
would
I
honestly
wish
I
naturally
outgoing
I
may
seem
outgoing
always
When
I
younger
I
shy
With
friends
neighborhood
I
normal
kid
In
school
I
pretty
damned
quiet
Every
year
elementary
school
I
sort
accelerated
program
Not
kids
would
make
something
When
I
first
grade
I
go
one
second
grade
classrooms
reading
Stuff
like
That
definitely
made
outcast
I
friends
school
I
started
playing
sports
recess
I
rarely
hung
anyone
I
still
quiet
9th
grade
At
point
I
less
forced
outgoing
I
started
cracking
jokes
loudmouth
opinionated
etc
etc
It
still
feels
like
show
farce
day
