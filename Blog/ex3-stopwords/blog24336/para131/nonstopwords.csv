I
remember
discussing
futility
regrowing
neurons
Neurobiology
class
first
semester
sophomore
year
It
decided
even
new
cells
could
transplanted
would
grow
neural
net
would
complex
cells
would
never
fully
integrate
The
University
Pittsburgh
Medical
Center
Pennsylvania
made
attempt
experiment
The
urlLink
results
show
neurons
helped
stroke
victims
regain
motor
control
A
promising
step
indeed
