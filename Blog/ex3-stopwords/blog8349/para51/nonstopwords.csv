Ok
quite
old
supposedly
people
urlLink
real
dirt
Apple
Cinema
Displays
While
sizes
seem
right
well
resolutions
couple
things
common
sense
state
work
First
switching
ADC
Apple
Display
Connector
DVI
I
think
Apple
really
likes
slick
wires
possible
With
dropping
ADC
lose
Video
Power
USB
one
cable
So
would
go
1
cable
3
cables
Which
brings
next
point
state
2
firewire
ports
How
possible
since
ADC
carry
firewire
signal
go
DVI
would
neither
USB
Firewire
So
4
wires
coming
display
Bleh
mind
many
features
see
happening
