Three
years
ago
Nan
died
Friday
thirteenth
She
died
sleep
sat
take
nap
middle
day
daughter
came
home
work
discovered
mother
longer
among
living
The
funeral
took
place
would
otherwise
gorgeous
autumn
afternoon
As
I
watched
casket
lowered
ground
I
could
help
ponder
irony
burying
grandmother
spiritual
rock
day
one
A
couple
years
later
family
buried
beloved
pet
Freckles
lost
brief
yet
painful
battle
liver
disease
ailment
common
amongst
male
cocker
spaniels
It
happened
fast
I
never
forget
mother
calling
tearfully
telling
passing
She
loved
dog
It
seems
much
pain
life
Sometimes
I
want
wail
Godde
I
know
power
cease
world
suffering
sadness
Then
moments
I
know
I
growing
stronger
suffering
I
endure
times
The
fall
perfect
time
year
reflect
strength
In
tradition
Celts
autumn
season
become
personal
New
Year
celebration
I
use
time
focus
goals
especially
since
I
habit
getting
distracted
summer
This
time
year
I
pay
homage
individuals
passed
veil
I
miss
There
still
days
I
feel
overwhelming
need
hear
voice
phone
hold
hand
When
I
realize
longer
possibility
sharp
pain
runs
straight
heart
It
takes
breath
away
I
start
leak
silent
tears
