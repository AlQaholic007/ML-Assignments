So
small
fearless
My
fickle
heart
My
brave
path
My
one
true
love
A
list
sins
Follow
wake
Trailing
Give
amnesty
Sophia
Protect
mourning
soul
And
comfort
love
starved
self
I
cling
I
pine
presence
Godde
Waiting
anxiously
taste
salvation
upon
lips
I
imagine
salvation
tastes
like
honey
like
green
tea
jasmine
like
salt
licked
man
post
coital
sweat
soaked
back
I
imagine
salvation
tastes
Wonderful
Who
I
fear
In
colourful
colour
stained
world
What
pagan
soul
I
unravelled
With
Jesus
freak
sensibilities
In
woman
arms
Your
arms
I
wish
lie
You
seem
like
grace
incarnate
Godde
manifest
Not
unreachable
Eager
traced
The
small
woman
back
gateway
womb
The
curve
neck
matching
pulse
point
life
Laying
shallow
valley
Of
breasts
center
heart
Godde
pulses
sweats
breathes
Alive
us
