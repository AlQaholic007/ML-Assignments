I
wait
Red
red
flow
marks
woman
Crimson
guilt
Of
sins
done
Committed
In
brazen
act
Of
passion
Once
I
pay
price
Of
using
body
To
speak
language
liberation
When
faerie
dust
disappear
Did
mother
Put
Away
My
favorite
doll
I
remember
simpler
time
Before
Red
Sea
glorious
might
Swept
away
body
Leaving
soul
wake
This
moment
That
belongs
Every
Woman
A
scare
A
lunar
flow
unshed
A
potential
choice
devastates
And
false
line
burns
Bright
pink
Hope
lies
cardboard
box
