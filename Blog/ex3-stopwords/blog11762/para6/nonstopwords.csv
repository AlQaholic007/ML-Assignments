Sunday
evening
I
went
church
first
time
since
confirmation
June
It
pathetic
sad
distracted
I
became
past
summer
Lust
overcame
heart
I
pulled
away
Godde
deserting
faith
simple
pleasures
skin
Yet
inevitable
happened
man
disappeared
life
I
found
clinging
faith
like
life
raft
Godde
became
glue
held
together
horrible
time
I
felt
slip
fingers
Godde
continues
hold
together
I
writing
words
It
felt
like
coming
home
I
received
communion
I
could
feel
overwhelming
sense
purpose
direction
flood
body
melting
soul
When
I
tasted
bread
first
time
months
dry
bitter
flavor
connected
others
church
When
I
drank
wine
I
could
feel
blood
Christ
renewing
strenghtening
preparing
road
ahead
Catholics
believe
Eucharist
involves
process
transubstantiation
bread
wine
literally
body
blood
Christ
Episcopalians
recognize
belief
tend
view
Eucharist
symbolic
act
rather
literal
one
In
opinion
Christianity
blessing
sacrament
Long
numerous
denominations
early
Christians
meeting
secret
receive
bread
wine
They
risked
persecution
even
became
martyrs
simple
act
The
Eucharist
invisible
rope
acknowledgement
sacrifice
Christ
binds
Christians
one
another
Growing
Southern
Baptist
tradition
I
received
communion
two
services
year
Christmas
Easter
I
never
considered
communion
active
part
faith
I
started
attending
services
Episcopal
church
I
thought
strange
Episcopalians
received
Eucharist
every
single
Sunday
without
fail
Now
I
longer
imagine
going
church
receiving
communion
I
go
world
It
ultimate
business
card
please
take
Savior
His
body
blood
wish
carry
inside
It
incredible
gift
This
reason
I
Christian
The
Eucharist
brought
comfort
relationship
Gene
falling
apart
I
know
number
theological
interpretations
within
world
wide
Christian
community
many
times
seems
community
fall
apart
The
Eucharist
binds
us
together
face
adversity
change
It
integral
part
faith
It
brings
Christians
back
church
even
gone
days
weeks
months
even
years
It
blessing
It
home
