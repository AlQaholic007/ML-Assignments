There
days
I
feel
new
experience
living
newborn
child
Those
moments
often
seem
simple
I
certain
I
missing
bigger
lesson
Like
speeding
car
passes
leaves
standing
searching
lonely
dirt
road
called
life
Introspection
wonderful
dangerous
thing
Thinking
much
hard
particular
topic
wear
emotionally
mentally
leave
confused
began
ponderings
I
think
Pooh
right
along
life
tiny
moments
comprise
insatiable
push
progress
human
race
seems
hell
bent
completing
Right
I
studying
final
exam
writing
paper
trying
pull
every
single
strand
hair
Right
I
learning
sit
back
relax
breathe
The
world
may
revolve
around
wait
little
