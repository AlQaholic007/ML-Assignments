DREAMS
Why
must
love
another
Last
week
I
lover
wife
favorite
friend
child
mother
You
came
door
words
I
long
hear
scripted
meticulously
missing
nothing
We
spoke
heart
dreamed
color
filling
skies
traveling
deserts
high
mountain
roads
I
gave
resume
heart
objective
clear
responded
delight
Pity
experience
Why
must
love
another
