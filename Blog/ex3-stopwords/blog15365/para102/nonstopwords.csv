GROWING
WINGS
Like
outpouring
void
even
knowing
said
next
comes
together
chorus
dos
The
eternal
question
strong
enough
someone
else
ask
without
question
mark
There
always
fear
never
enough
mistakes
offered
like
proof
I
turned
air
conditioner
since
I
home
someplace
I
surrounds
like
fog
come
trees
seven
clock
morning
