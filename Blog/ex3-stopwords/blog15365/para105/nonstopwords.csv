STILL
NOT
COMING
BACK
I
could
probably
stay
awake
rest
life
frenzied
marathon
poetry
writing
It
started
tickle
gash
I
felt
purging
home
wood
Big
trash
day
coming
take
away
rest
I
returned
memories
asking
please
go
never
never
And
I
boast
pain
I
imagine
fears
take
hold
drive
away
always
never
turning
back
take
arms
You
apologized
parted
embrace
afternoon
I
sorry
I
need
assured
let
go
You
never
knew
I
asked
keep
holding
little
longer
knowing
worth
asking
