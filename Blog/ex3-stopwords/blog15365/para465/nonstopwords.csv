Impossible
Dream
To
dream
impossible
dream
To
fight
unbeatable
foe
To
bear
unbearable
sorrow
And
run
brave
dare
go
To
right
unrightable
wrong
And
love
pure
chaste
afar
To
try
arms
weary
To
reach
unreachable
star
This
quest
To
follow
star
No
matter
hopeless
No
matter
far
To
fight
right
Without
question
pause
To
willing
march
march
hell
For
heavenly
cause
And
I
know
If
I
true
To
glorious
quest
That
heart
Will
lie
peaceful
calm
When
I
laid
rest
And
world
better
That
one
man
scorned
covered
scars
Still
strove
last
ounce
courage
To
reach
unreachable
unreachable
The
unreachable
star
And
I
always
dream
The
impossible
dream
Yes
I
reach
The
unreachable
star
