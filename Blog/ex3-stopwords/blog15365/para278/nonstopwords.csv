GLORY
BOX
I
tired
playing
Playing
bow
arrow
Gonna
give
heart
away
Leave
girls
play
For
I
temptress
long
Just
Give
reason
love
Give
reason
ee
woman
I
wanna
woman
From
time
unchained
We
looking
different
picture
Thru
new
frame
mind
A
thousand
flowers
could
bloom
Move
give
us
room
Give
reason
love
Give
reason
ee
woman
I
wanna
woman
INSTRUMENTAL
So
stop
man
Just
take
little
look
side
Sow
little
tenderness
No
matter
cry
Give
reason
love
Give
reason
ee
woman
Its
I
wanna
woman
For
beginning
forever
ever
Its
time
move
