All
things
must
pass
George
Harrison
Sunrise
last
morning
A
cloudburst
last
day
Seems
love
left
warning
It
always
going
grey
All
things
must
pass
All
things
must
pass
away
Sunset
last
evening
A
mind
blow
clouds
away
After
love
must
leaving
It
always
going
grey
All
things
must
pass
All
things
must
pass
away
All
things
must
pass
None
life
strings
last
So
I
must
way
And
face
another
day
Now
darkness
stays
night
time
In
morning
fade
away
Daylight
good
arriving
right
time
It
always
going
grey
All
things
must
pass
All
things
must
pass
away
All
things
must
pass
All
things
must
pass
away
