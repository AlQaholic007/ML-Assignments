WHEN
YOU
LEARNED
OF
MY
NAME
10
years
ago
place
nothing
mattered
much
I
could
drink
liquor
store
close
house
Food
Lion
beer
Still
I
wrote
feriocious
intensity
love
lost
forlorn
fantasies
never
formed
And
memories
drunken
pounding
fingers
keyboard
new
color
screen
computer
I
remember
sending
poems
though
I
remember
ones
might
known
learned
name
I
anybody
else
time
know
wine
I
came
men
I
And
I
know
someone
real
housed
castle
empties
casting
net
onto
page
Dead
Man
chair
Conversations
ensued
even
remember
memory
important
holy
even
There
time
yet
enough
time
world
time
roles
expectations
grow
one
hair
long
shave
beard
Who
heard
nothing
said
still
I
wonder
know
I
hear
mind
saying
yes
thousand
times
I
saying
nothing
loud
even
covering
smile
poker
faced
dream
coming
forward
painting
moon
mine
school
park
exactly
yes
ashes
car
bowl
vomit
