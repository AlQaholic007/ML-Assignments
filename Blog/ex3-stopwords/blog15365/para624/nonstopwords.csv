The
Winter
Listening
No
one
fire
hands
burning
red
palms
night
wind
carries
everything
away
outside
All
petty
worry
great
cloak
sky
grows
dark
intense
round
every
living
thing
What
precious
inside
us
care
known
mind
ways
diminish
presence
What
strive
perfection
turns
us
lit
angel
desire
disturbs
nourishes
everything
need
What
hate
cannot
know
true
pattern
need
explained
Inside
everyone
great
shout
joy
waiting
born
Even
summer
far
I
feel
grown
ready
arrive
world
All
years
listening
nothing
say
All
years
forgetting
everything
voice
make
heard
All
years
forgetting
easily
belong
everything
simply
listening
And
slow
difficulty
remembering
everything
born
opposite
miraculous
otherness
Silence
winter
led
otherness
So
let
winter
listening
enough
new
life
I
must
call
