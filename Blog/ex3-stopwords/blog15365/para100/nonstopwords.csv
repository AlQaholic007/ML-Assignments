GO
ON
For
five
days
I
without
mirror
I
guess
shirt
looks
right
skirt
look
sideways
glancing
really
It
spring
piata
party
My
amnesia
lifted
time
I
hit
bat
I
looking
around
kids
Tonight
even
poet
asks
moon
Gemini
even
I
look
rational
Thoughts
stretch
sun
flip
Everyone
else
found
answers
I
spent
life
interviewing
wrong
person
