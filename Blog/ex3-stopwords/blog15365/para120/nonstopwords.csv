GERMINATION
The
flowers
gave
beginning
open
window
sill
red
rose
taking
new
shape
day
progresses
overpowering
black
eyed
susans
As
gift
Spot
I
bring
vase
patio
sprawls
catlike
bliss
current
dining
room
table
Stretching
purrs
rubbing
face
leaves
losing
balance
wonder
smells
leaves
tiny
yellow
petals
reaching
branches
lizard
catches
eye
remembering
bouquet
held
hands
night
last
