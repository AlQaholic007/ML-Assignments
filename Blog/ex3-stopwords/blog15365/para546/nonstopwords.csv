rest
man
placed
upon
steps
baby
cries
high
church
bells
start
ring
heaviness
body
oh
heaviness
settles
somewhere
hear
mother
sing
one
foot
step
onto
road
much
weight
much
weight
long
far
many
times
late
calling
angels
calling
angels
walk
one
leave
alone
calling
angels
calling
angels
cryin
hurtin
sure
every
day
gaze
upon
sunset
love
intensity
almost
could
crack
code
finally
understand
means
could
think
would
trade
pain
suffering
ah
miss
beauty
light
upon
earth
sweetness
leaving
calling
angels
calling
angels
walk
one
leave
alone
callin
angels
callin
angels
tryin
hopin
hurtin
lovin
cryin
callin
cause
sure
goes
