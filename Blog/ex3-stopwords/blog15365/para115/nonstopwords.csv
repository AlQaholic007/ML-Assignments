Maybe
dreams
overreaching
money
excuse
real
enough
owning
pain
rented
My
grandmother
dying
paid
nurse
held
hand
I
asked
Mother
money
buys
In
silent
shame
I
knew
truth
books
bold
enough
hold
words
I
born
wound
made
earth
accident
I
look
sky
answers
clouds
free
I
look
sky
moon
rising
reliable
egg
letting
go
womb
She
woman
looking
believe
exists
Even
still
hands
stretch
thumb
forefinger
holding
fragile
peace
Even
still
breathing
lights
room
darker
knows
reaching
ways
see
feel
understands
