Lyrics
John
Grey
Some
people
think
free
get
want
nothing
nothing
else
people
want
lead
life
others
want
follow
ok
cuz
every
man
got
walk
way
Don
hesitating
contemplating
waiting
got
live
free
Wealth
necessary
think
scary
quite
contrary
got
live
free
Some
people
complicate
lives
others
keep
simple
little
bit
closer
truth
seek
We
pledge
allegiance
anything
takes
mind
away
Freedom
cheap
naw
freedom
easy
get
Don
let
go
let
go
Don
hesitating
contemplating
waiting
got
live
free
Wealth
necessary
think
scary
quite
contrary
got
live
free
things
say
things
mean
thing
live
free
things
say
things
mean
thing
live
free
