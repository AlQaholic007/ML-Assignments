Fast
Changes
Maybe
I
search
mind
little
I
come
across
reason
gone
Maybe
I
searched
little
And
I
try
reconcile
little
Then
maybe
I
know
long
This
time
Well
separate
rooms
I
hear
sighing
Saying
No
way
seems
Dry
tears
flying
straight
window
Fast
changes
arriving
Slow
changes
moving
Here
Now
maybe
I
took
time
little
Then
maybe
I
would
know
long
This
time
Here
In
separate
rooms
I
hear
sighing
Saying
No
way
seems
Dry
tears
flying
straight
window
fast
changes
Fast
changes
arriving
come
around
slow
changes
Slow
change
moving
moving
Here
Fast
changes
come
around
slow
changes
Fast
changes
arriving
Are
moving
And
slow
change
moving
Here
Here
A
Change
Ohh
Here
separate
rooms
I
hear
crying
Saying
No
way
seems
Dry
tears
flying
straight
window
fast
changes
They
come
around
slow
changes
moving
Fast
change
arriving
slow
change
moving
Fast
change
arriving
They
come
around
slow
change
And
slow
change
moving
moving
Here
fast
change
arriving
fast
changes
come
around
slow
changes
Are
moving
Slow
change

Here
Fast

They
come
