CLUES
AND
ILLUSIONS
At
point
really
matter
I
say
sound
coming
like
nothing
something
maybe
less
These
images
flash
I
unsure
I
I
I
found
close
home
without
conscience
carved
honest
mistakes
Best
wait
something
resembling
silence
take
place
feeling
place
pointed
No
competition
worth
We
meaning
something
even
I
understand
like
song
going
head
quit
singing
someone
else
makes
worse
A
spotlight
stage
behind
walls
less
Burn
light
leaving
long
shadow
crevasse
camouflage
It
makes
difference
Words
must
come
somewhere
targets
slow
come
To
know
oneself
monster
angel
containing
equal
parts
poorly
bargained
balance
Deny
nothing
Keep
Keep
hands
car
times
Rhetoric
righteousness
shaky
foundation
roughness
sand
castles
What
could
known
Who
else
expect
forgive
forget
truth
much
much
It
comes
wash
said
someone
helping
even
ways
I
see
ways
I
see
