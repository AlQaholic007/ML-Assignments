Are
We
Not
Geeks
Tolkien
keen
readers
often
criticised
stuck
eternal
adolescence
labelled
geeks
I
like
take
closer
look
labels
Consider
many
useful
pragmatic
people
read
therapy
self
help
books
want
fulfil
potential
balanced
self
aware
individuals
Many
books
talk
notion
nurturing
one
inner
child
The
inner
child
part
us
feels
enthusiasm
joy
strongly
responds
truthfully
world
Well
good
evidently
inner
child
regarded
good
precious
But
say
inner
adolescent
Why
nurturing
inner
adolescent
I
think
hardly
say
phrase
teenager
days
without
immediately
thinking
somebody
rebellious
confused
remembering
one
years
irritable
awkwardness
We
got
lot
good
say
teenagers
yet
The
author
Philip
Pullman
wrote
something
interesting
response
question
preferred
write
teenagers
At
age
said
children
becoming
aware
world
new
way
time
ask
big
questions
What
meaning
life
purpose
Later
get
busy
get
cynical
danger
forgetting
ever
cared
I
agree
I
go
say
many
teenagers
years
time
great
stress
partly
age
idealism
yet
beginning
learn
world
tired
habits
petty
hypocrisies
callous
persecutions
deadly
evasions
responsibility
casual
negligence
towards
justice
ignoble
worms
greed
gnaw
away
heart
every
great
enterprise
Teenagers
rage
wrongness
world
see
freshly
wounds
keenly
As
one
becomes
older
wiser
tireder
seems
less
hassle
take
easy
course
act
circumspectly
politic
often
honest
I
think
teenagers
rage
growing
state
best
still
believe
change
world
virtue
naming
confronting
evils
I
like
throw
one
ultimate
Romantic
poems
I
ever
come
across
It
Argentinean
poet
sums
idealism
adolescence
rejects
deceitful
world
one
grand
gesture
For
Afterwards
I
would
like
die
day
ending
open
sea
looking
sky
agony
death
may
seem
sleep
soul
may
seem
bird
mounts
flight
And
final
instants
I
would
hear
already
sky
sea
alone
sobbing
prayers
sobbing
voices
waves
majestic
fall
To
die
life
sadly
hauling
back
golden
nets
tide
deep
green
like
yonder
sun
dies
slowly
shining
thing
lost
sight
To
die
young
unfaithful
time
destroys
delicate
gentle
crown
whilst
life
still
tells
us
I
although
know
well
betray
us

Yes

It

would

I
could
bear

For
inner
teenager
Tolkien
many
fantasy
books
appeal
They
books
honour
justice
recognition
absolute
good
evil
books
daring
courage
ultimate
sacrifices
grand
gestures
hopeless
odds
Nobody
lost
inner

flung

life
decided
change

Sadly

send
young

injustice
called
inner

Because
teenagers
look

name
truthfully
whether
society
wants
hear
The
whole
question
geekdom
interested
Other
people
involved
writing
I
take
liberty
pre
empting
extensive
study
thoughts
Firstly
geek
Articles
like
Julian
Dibbell
Lord
Geeks
article
Village
Voice
seem
deride
geeks
minority
outsiders
simultaneously
fearing
vast
inchoate
conspiracy
controls
technology
underpinning
modern
world
They
losers
thinks
unfair
twist
fate
genetics
get
spend
lives
cool
things
art
science
technology
popular
culture
media
And
I
might
add
get
shockingly
rich
travel
round
world
pains
My
definition
geeks
A
geek
cares
subject
system
much
willing
learn

whether
anyone
else
cares
The

The
larger
group
non
geeks
always
going

somebody

In

able

Geeks

There
