BACK
FROM
NOWHERE
For
weeks
wind
howling
backwards
blowing
leaf
sound
rumble
inside
like
passing
train
The
whistle
never
blows
town
far
major
arteries
still
tracks
cross
back
forth
harder
bike
And
home
I
keep
reminding
happy
I
much
shade
I
keep
reminding
lucky
I
found
someone
live
faults
little
lines
open
earth
crack
fill
water
And
I
keep
reminding
okay
live
without
forever
word
anyway
Nights
like
distant
traffic
sounds
Waldo
Road
comforting
waves
reaching
shore
I
still
strain
hear
planes
helicopter
landing
Broward
General
searching
crime
It
small
town
life
space
smaller
I
still
learning
share
It
much
easier
give
You
asleep
resting
work
dreams
I
understand
Sometimes
I
wonder
closer
apart
