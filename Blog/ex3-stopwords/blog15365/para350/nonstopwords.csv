Rouge
2001
Never
knew
I
could
feel
like
Like
I
never
seen
sky
I
want
vanish
inside
kiss
Every
day
I
loving
Listen
heart
hear
sings
Telling
give
everything
Seasons
may
change
winter
spring
But
I
love
untill
end
time
Come
may
Come
may
I
love
dying
day
Suddenly
world
seems
perfect
place
Suddenly
moves
perfect
grace
Suddenly
life
seem
waste
It
revolves
around
And
mountain
high
No
river
wide
Sing
song
I
side
Storm
clouds
may
gather
And
stars
may
collide
But
I
love
end
time
Repeat
Oh
come
may
come
may
I
love
I
love
Suddenly
world
seems
perfect
place
