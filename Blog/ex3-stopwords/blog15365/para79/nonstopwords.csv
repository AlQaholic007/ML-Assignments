STAND
BY
Disillusioned
I
soar
bird
clipped
wings
finding
last
I
fire
offer
universe
along
Alone
I
hide
gifts
unwrapped
bowless
universe
cared
another
utopian
dream
direction
love
pointed
open
heart
mute
And
tears
could
turn
dry
earth
mud
soil
could
change
world
throw
flame
let
ashes
proof
clay
hands
I
nothing
I
one
last
liquid
poured
sieve
self
gone
What
good
desire
serve
desire
cuts
divides
halves
There
pieces
I
leave
behind
leaving
dreams
unfulfilled
faith
crushed
fist
rumpled
ball
tossed
much
rubbish
So
I
tell
voice
back
I
failed
I
faltered
I
gazed
mirror
reflected
none
seen
vision
pissed
balloons
cast
sea
I
whimper
I
moth
dragon
weak
withdrawn
retreat
cage
fingers
lock
door
without
key
And
end
one
come
I
remember
nights
without
sleep
weight
passion
pounding
belief
door
knocked
knocked
knew
peace
My
back
strong
inside
much
light
thought
orbits
like
stars
like
earth
around
sun
moon
never
came
certainty
I
watched
picture
fade
I
knew
time
even
I
could
stand
make
decision
strong
bone
blood
feelings
like
magnets
hold
chair
true
move
Like
faucets
like
data
cables
I
divert
eyes
danger
like
God
house
salvation
rather
inside
believing
failure
uncertain
success
may
come
I
resign
position
mood
director
I
relinquish
smile
strangers
mind
master
brandishing
whip
every
indescretion
indecisive
move
It
hangs
solar
plexus
like
indigestion
I
squandered
power
I
trusted
I
could
made
promises
I
keep
I
buried
toy
shovel
lost
place
lost
way
I
spin
spin
gather
speed
bursts
dull
light
explosions
average
ego
kicks
screams
echoing
well
I
forgive
one
gardners
planting
hope
despair
Not
even
weeds
could
sprout
baked
desert
cracks
soul
Even
cactus
gave
rain
shriveled
stick
thorns
still
sharp
Nothing
guess
reality
unveiled
pathetic
escape
plans
scrawled
This
weakness
Look
man
behind
curtain
gaze
upon
face
I
ask
none
help
hinderance
suckled
lies
foolish
needy
trusing
lips
nipple
dead
weight
aspirations
bullshit
faith
abilities
tears
well
unable
keep
together
even
hour
half
plane
ride
