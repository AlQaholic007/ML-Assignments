In
The
Arms
Of
The
Angels
Sarah
Mclachlan
Spend
time
waiting
second
chance
break
would
make
okay
always
one
reason
feel
good
enough
hard
end
day
I
need
distraction
oh
beautiful
release
memory
seeps
veins
let
empty
oh
weightless
maybe
I
find
peace
tonight
arms
angel
fly
away
dark
cold
hotel
room
endlessness
fear
pulled
wreckage
silent
reverie
arms
angel
may
find
comfort
tired
straight
line
everywhere
turn
vultures
thieves
back
storm
keeps
twisting
keep
building
lies
make
lack
make
difference
escaping
one
last
time
easier
believe
sweet
madness
oh
oh
glorious
sadness
brings
knees
arms
angel
fly
away
dark
cold
hotel
room
endlessness
fear
pulled
wreckage
silent
reverie
arms
angel
may
find
comfort
