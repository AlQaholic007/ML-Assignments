AND
THEY
ARE
OFF
I
write
without
stopping
like
someone
shot
gun
race
To
fair
I
allow
breaks
time
To
proper
I
forgive
critics
whose
jobs
set
straight
number
important
details
creativity
well
good
keep
within
established
rules
love
blessing
even
exactly
way
thought
hey
little
fucking
humor
time
time
break
Because
I
gone
back
time
read
words
meant
even
feet
table
legs
slagging
edge
cigarette
smoked
getting
smaller
I
want
I
get
full
I
wiser
far
girl
I
Nothing
quite
dark
grim
I
never
talk
hell
anymore
must
resolved
I
mortared
many
bricks
build
fine
home
using
tools
I
well
taught
duty
loyalty
obligation
sacrifice
They
paid
bills
brought
hunks
marked
acrylic
name
center
Let
someone
else
get
applause
It
end
less
mattered
I
might
thought
I
awakened
reality
I
sleeping
inside
realtor
looking
jackets
sweating
leather
flats
I
kept
abundance
trunk
car
case
I
forget
wear
shoes
