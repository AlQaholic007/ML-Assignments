BACK
AND
FORTH
There
truths
told
promises
broken
like
time
passes
street
corners
summer
neglected
passed
judgment
songs
stop
conversations
going
nowhere
The
middle
path
reminder
echoes
fly
like
hawks
high
La
Ventana
calling
home
time
marked
different
countries
Over
everything
nothing
blame
comes
farewells
predicted
tea
leaves
strained
voice
someone
knowing
nothing
something
peach
tree
orchard
lost
virginities
misled
suitors
looking
magic
rabbits
dead
hat
The
next
song
starts
speaker
phone
beyond
understanding
control
drummer
boy
playing
background
without
frankincense
louder
still
drown
fingers
stretching
across
time
He
asks
found
enlightenment
yet
knows
love
In
state
control
without
control
knowing
glances
smiles
men
chests
pressed
The
owl
came
patio
looked
eyes
truth
matter
examined
heard
music
first
time
pretending
second
time
happened
first
time
happened
air
neck
ceiling
fan
fan
floor
wind
calls
canyons
Farmington
secrets
giving
completely
enough
end
