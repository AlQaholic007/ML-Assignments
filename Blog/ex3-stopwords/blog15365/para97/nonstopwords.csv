THERE
S
NO
PLACE
LIKE
For
seven
years
I
lived
next
door
mermaid
At
night
hangs
tails
line
stretched
across
car
port
I
know
name
knows
mine
The
rest
neighbors
strangers
stranger
still
days
filling
spaces
SUVs
children
taken
hand
I
outgrown
home
outclassed
outmortgaged
outside
taking
recycling
Friday
wondering
got
different
