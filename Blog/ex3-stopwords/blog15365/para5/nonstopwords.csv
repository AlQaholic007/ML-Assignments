I
recently
spent
weekend
Chicago
city
encased
meat
Just
poor
critter
ground
stuffed
swag
intestine
boiled
grilled
served
bun
bought
couple
bucks
every
blocks
one
ubiquitous
hot
dog
stands
At
Hot
Doug
example
aside
traditional
pork
beef
wieners
chicken
pheasant
wild
boar
lamb
tube
steaks
But
also
rumors
veggie
dog
animal
munching
friend
Emily
lured
popular
bratwurst
bistro
Because
fact
although
I
vegan
I
fool
fake
meat
Or
anything
really
serve
vehicle
condiments
eaten
alongside
French
fries
lowbrow
atmosphere
better
diners
burger
shacks
carnival
snack
stands
These
food
venues
usually
fall
short
fried
faux
meat
category
might
imagine
But
I
guess
Chicago
city
teeming
working
class
hipsters
two
fisted
liberals
Studs
Terkel
refers
folks
whose
proletariat
taste
buds
sometimes
clash
compassionate
eating
ethics
local
sausage
slingers
make
concessions
concessions
I
one
thank
Doug
colleagues
That
one
damn
good
dog
Char
grilled
onions
pickle
spear
neon
relish
tomato
slices
yellow
mustard
overflowing
squishy
roll
I
returned
home
unabatable
hankering
faux
dog
fixings
donned
first
shorts
season
set
crazy
notion
I
might
able
score
veggie
dog
one
local
hot
dog
haunts
I
dragged
boyfriend
Art
along
taste
test
real
ones
I
f
want

95

Bob
snorted
That
would
sacrilegious
But
I
Chicago
This
Chicago
He
said
walked
away
Was
really
pissed
grouchy
guy
general
Maybe
I
naïve
subversive
nature
soy
protein
And
I
wanted
one
place
spend
money
good
cheap
grub
I
sat
rickety
stool
ordered
French
fries
blathered
writing
food
review
The
fry
cook
looked
like
Billy
Bob
Thornton
playing
surly
fry
cook
shook
head
disgust
muttered
something
write
food
review
eat
French
fries
These
guys
30s
early
40s
tops
grumpy
old
geezer
thing
Their
disdain
thick
mystery
oil
deep
frying
yup
deep
frying
dogs
In
fairness
server
swankier
Swankies
Westport
super
friendly
Let
consider
first
location
Skanky
Frank
confuse
two
She
smiled
everything
The
place
also
looked
like
intimate
paintbrush
sponge
recent
memory
Art
highly
approved
deep
fried
technique
It
makes
texture
crackly
snappy
Snappy
Yeah
hot
dogs
snappy
The
skin
give
right
away
bite
snaps
He
also
liked
raw
onions
self
serve
For
sake
quality
assurance
ordered
dog
toppings
every
stop
bacon
ketchup
onions
The
bacon
dog
noted
The
French
fries
great
thin
cut
skin
left
dirty
taste
super
crisp
crisped
We
liked
