THE
MOON
WAS
STILL
UP
Anger
pain
I
understand
far
underneath
skin
even
poetry
release
rewards
You
compete
music
played
drown
purpose
though
guitar
light
could
flood
landscape
yesterday
bright
pieces
puzzle
glued
cardboard
signify
end
Struggle
synthesized
equalizing
waves
water
washing
brand
new
day
lighthouse
rocky
shores
Memory
unlatches
paper
petroglyphs
exactly
right
time
even
though
words
faint
hear
lyrics
Van
Morrison
possibility
completely
wrong
