Rufus
Wainwright
Lyrics
Shadows
Who
keep
Keep
evening
Even
though
They
I
could
great
star
Still
I
far
happy
Finally
Feel
world
around
Fighting
Fighting
whiskey
I
could
great
star
Still
I
far
happy
Out
shadows
Comes
light
Shadows
comes
light
You
keep
Keep
evening
Even
though
You
I
could
great
star
Still
I
far
happy
I
could
great
star
I
could
great
star
I
could
great
star
I
could
great
star
Out
shadows
Comes
light
Out
shadows
Comes
light
Shadows
comes
light
