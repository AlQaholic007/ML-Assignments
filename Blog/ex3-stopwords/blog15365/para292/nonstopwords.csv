I
sit
two
stories
street
It
awful
quiet
since
love
fell
asleep
There
life
though
kids
walking
home
school
So
long
ago
taught
That
whatever
kind
puzzle
got
You
stick
right
formula
solution
every
fool
I
remember
time
I
came
close
Sent
skipping
class
running
school
And
I
bought
ring
cause
I
never
cool
What
makes
think
I
start
clean
slated
The
hardest
learn
least
complicated
So
I
sit
house
resist
And
seen
I
cease
exist
A
kind
conscientious
objection
kind
dodging
draft
Boy
girl
holding
hands
street
And
I
want
I
think
wait
It
eye
eye
learn
things
I
could
never
apply
I
remember
time
I
came
close
I
let
everything
go
seemed
truth
And
I
bought
ring
seemed
thing
What
makes
think
I
start
clean
slated
The
hardest
learn
least
complicated
What
makes
think
I
start
clean
slated
The
hardest
learn
least
complicated
Oh
I
mirror
mirror
All
things
I
And
next
time
I
fall
I
going
recall
It
love
something
new
