FROM
FLAMES
If
answer
questions
would
stop
nothing
left
ask
silence
could
recognize
I
reached
stars
I
followed
shamans
sleeping
shadows
passed
sighs
discontent
crept
stairs
sameness
felt
pains
misunderstood
strangers
wanting
loved
spark
light
others
ignored
I
dusted
shined
though
God
cared
something
cleaner
strength
night
folded
time
marked
one
leg
raised
love
rested
unrequited
What
afraid
wait
even
first
step
emerge
abyss
leg
twitch
towards
liberation
I
followed
map
oblivion
time
time
I
realized
representation
I
gagged
bound
ego
retribution
drove
past
dream
Self
ultimate
trip
path
illusory
greatness
Still
songs
played
like
trickling
fingertips
skin
light
playful
wanting
Still
lyrics
illuminated
enoughness
love
regardless
regard
And
night
folded
marking
time
man
made
clocks
towards
un
timely
demise
time
arise
flames
like
Phoenix
brightly
colored
wings
flies
Flap
flap
flap
