CLOSER
Holding
feelings
drawn
quartered
possible
fantasies
improbable
futures
I
wonder
awe
She
gave
sample
bottle
perfume
called
Miracle
use
adventures
far
water
turned
wine
I
beside
inside
rehearsing
rehashing
afraid
pick
phone
call
event
may
ring
You
living
different
time
I
know
well
pretend
minutes
pass
measured
mixing
metric
increments
The
window
opportunity
time
known
days
pass
towards
arrival
though
leaning
forward
I
unsure
feelings
I
willing
sacrifice
name
Such
statements
come
easy
I
imagined
It
I
know
eyes
full
stars
inner
knowing
moon
look
tonight
rising
water
