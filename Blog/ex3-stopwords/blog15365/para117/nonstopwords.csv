SOMEPLACE
NEW
AGAIN
I
trolling
visions
The
fish
never
bite
I
feel
kind
funny
pulling
depths
considering
bends
Though
flashy
colors
neon
always
caught
fancy
I
realize
pretty
remains
eyes
closed
Life
everywhere
I
Life
kaleidoscope
I
late
feeling
magic
dreams
cast
neighbors
happiness
found
simply
happy
After
freedom
freeing
everyone
else
Let
everyone
find
cloud
monsters
try
break
power
alone
Let
everybody
find
set
flannel
sheets
sleep
comfortably
night
We
ride
bikes
parallel
paths
I
inches
We
climb
mountains
weight
gravity
tugging
boots
I
idea
rope
hold
The
end
result
never
really
ending
begin
case
think
arrived
someplace
new
