AFTER
A
DAY
AT
HOSPICE
How
slowly
stages
pass
gradual
slope
learning
summer
passes
without
concern
The
days
lengthen
stretch
beyond
us
blanketed
nurses
kindness
patience
With
Grandma
moments
lets
know
grip
hand
still
Sometimes
smile
beautiful
beyond
skies
There
days
comforted
weak
tears
falling
unashamed
love
woman
given
much
acceptance
concern
gentle
respect
simple
truths
I
remember
weeks
ago
hot
walk
Hospice
house
I
came
took
hands
mine
With
silence
drew
lips
blow
cool
This
love
It
I
learned
tenderness
It
I
learned
care
These
thoughts
riding
bike
home
thanking
legs
heart
health
Home
I
hesitate
would
make
feel
good
even
tension
shoulders
neck
face
reminds
still
There
little
time
souvenirs
memories
made
forgiveness
granted
night
passes
another
day
lessons
farewells
