Album
Let
It
Be
When
I
find
times
trouble
Mother
Mary
comes
Speaking
words
wisdom
let
And
hour
darkness
She
standing
right
front
Speaking
words
wisdom
let
Let
let
Whisper
words
wisdom
let
And
broken
hearted
people
Living
world
agree
There
answer
let
For
though
may
parted
Still
chance
see
There
answer
let
Let
let
Yeah
There
answer
let
And
night
cloudy
There
still
light
shines
Shine
tomorrow
let
I
wake
sound
music
Mother
Mary
comes
Speaking
words
wisdom
let
Let
let
There
answer
let
Let
let
Whisper
words
wisdom
let
