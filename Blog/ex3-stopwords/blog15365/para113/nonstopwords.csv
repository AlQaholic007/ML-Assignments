DISSEMINATING
ARIES
Even
though
night
fades
I
hold
connection
like
sunrise
sings
moon
sleep
drives
truth
hiding
memories
future
hopes
meaning
Nothing
come
true
yet
matter
As
long
breath
explain
similarities
shadows
passed
misdemeanors
youth
lost
excuses
someone
Regulating
behavior
completely
within
rights
individual
law
states
Guidelines
drawn
poster
big
glossy
matte
depending
given
day
given
The
stand
still
answers
questions
posed
swords
drawn
fight
death
ego
Not
everyone
famous
past
lives
us
even
supposed
exactly
right
regardless
likes
Those
us
always
less
worthy
lifting
truths
known
remembered
The
burden
keeping
silent
celebrated
first
sign
sound
And
though
may
nothing
I
found
loss
known
like
straightening
spine
rainbows
climb
back
