Fortissimo
Sleep
beckons
words
read
peal
like
bells
memory
I
wonder
prone
condition
curious
demanding
style
already
changed
forever
like
I
think
suppose
I
beyond
knowing
always
Merge
create
The
colors
begin
blur
oils
mixed
thick
haste
cover
pale
absence
light
Chords
stuck
first
time
harmony
even
trying
aspiring
opus
unfolding
I
bloom
