The
Journey
Above
mountains
geese
turn
light
Painting
black
silhouettes
open
sky
Sometimes
everything
enscribed
across
heavens
find
one
line
already
written
inside
Sometimes
takes
great
sky
find
small
bright
indescribable
wedge
freedom
heart
Sometimes
bones
black
sticks
left
fire
gone
someone
written
something
new
ashes
life
You
leaving
arriving
