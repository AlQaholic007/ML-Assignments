EQUINOX
Tommorrow
put
hold
faith
hope
love
shelved
cans
film
jar
ideas
filled
brine
awaiting
different
freedom
This
summer
equinox
knocks
find
barely
awake
passing
cursing
light
heal
another
suffering
It
rained
day
tell
600
persons
evacuated
flooding
talk
There
fire
flies
far
city
anyway
even
grasses
dry
crickets
would
grind
softer
I
promised
meaning
life
time
uncle
I
got
drunk
dozen
Christmasses
ago
I
immerse
like
bath
gravy
barely
float
I
shovel
walk
every
morning
I
wake
notice
passing
last
quarter
moon
rises
behind
clouds
Decades
young
retire
life
I
give
anyway
I
stand
accused
dreaming
world
good
real
Evidence
presented
without
spell
check
great
abundance
good
masses
They
tell
fears
wish
well
enough
alone
trapped
prisons
regret
I
stand
inside
cell
tonight
I
know
way
around
even
dark
