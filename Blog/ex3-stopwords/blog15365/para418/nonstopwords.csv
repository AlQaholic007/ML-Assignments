Commentary
The
Inner
Voice
speaks
words
wordless
language
heart
It
like
oracle
speaks
truth
If
face
would
like
face
center
card
alert
watchful
able
accept
dark
light
symbolized
two
hands
holding
crystal
The
crystal
represents
clarity
comes
transcending
dualities
The
Inner
Voice
also
playful
dives
deep
emotions
emerges
soar
towards
sky
like
two
dolphins
dancing
waters
life
It
connected
cosmos
crescent
moon
crown
earth
represented
green
leaves
figure
kimono
There
times
lives
many
voices
seem
pulling
us
way
Our
confusion
situations
reminder
seek
silence
centering
within
Only
able
hear
truth
