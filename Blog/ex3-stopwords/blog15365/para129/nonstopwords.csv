I
saw
sun
narrow
slits
clouds
forming

arms
around

Each
stage
dying
mattered
ways
age
giving
something
lent
A
thousand
opportunities

Beasts

No

left
chance
craving

moment
moves
And
wind
And
sail
And

galley
And
passing
hour
memory
yesterday
tomorrow
muddled
hands
still
clenching
like
baby
fist
Knowing

could
letting
go
easy
Merge

Welcome
home
distracting
ending
one
