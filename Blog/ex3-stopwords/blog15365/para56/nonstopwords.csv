DETACHMENT
My
mother
right
The
bone
stronger
place
break
I
remember
I
listen
sound
car
turning
back
I
listening
13
years
never
come
This
time
different
Your
goodbye
leaves
scattered
pieces
heart
I
mended
I
tended
carefully
past
four
months
papers
signed
And
tears
come
like
air
sobs
hard
like
sprinter
gasp
I
find
peace
deep
waters
shaken
surface
So
alone
refuse
love
I
know
love
I
felt
six
years
unsurmountable
task
communication
We
could
find
network
could
bring
us
together
cables
long
enough
strong
enough
channel
feelings
And
I
wait
hear
say
Maybe
think
silence
hurt
feelings
much
I
hear
truth
Why
like
us
You
man
whose
love
I
ever
wanted
Time
means
nothing
still
hurt
much
