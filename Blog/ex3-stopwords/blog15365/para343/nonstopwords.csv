Scientists

The
first
categories
Gravitational

The
third

Weak
Nuclear
Force
responsible

The

This

forced

continue

basis
long

Their

mysterious
5th
field
led
speculate
sub

described
ancient
sages
Luminiferous
Ether
It
believed

would
fill

extremely
subtle

To
world
science
metaphysical
possibility
considered
viable
physicists
convinced
etheric
forces
played
significant

But
upon
closer
investigation
come
believe
Etheric
may
hold

elusive
5th
field
Leading
theoreticians
conclude
invisible

Since

However
following
recent
discoveries
forced

new
theories
suggest
Quantum
Vacuum
highly
charged
cosmic
medium
energy
filled

whose
subtle
order
measurably
influences

Scientists
agree
Quantum
Vacuum
gave

And
also
believe
5th

seeking

A
number
physicists
suspect

hold

The
discovery
