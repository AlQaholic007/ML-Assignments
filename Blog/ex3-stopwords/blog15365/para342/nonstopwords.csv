Tarot
Patience
We
forgotten
wait
almost
abandoned
space
And
greatest
treasure
able
wait
right
moment
The
whole
existence
waits
right
moment
Even
trees
know
time
bring
flowers
time
let
go
leaves
stand
naked
sky
They
still
beautiful
nakedness
waiting
new
foliage
great
trust
old
gone
new
soon
coming
new
leaves
start
growing
We
forgotten
wait
want
everything
hurry
It
great
loss
humanity
In
silence
waiting
something
inside
goes
growing
authentic
And
one
day
jumps
becomes
flame
whole
personality
shattered
new
man
And
new
man
knows
ceremony
new
man
knows
life
eternal
juices
There
times
thing
wait
The
seed
planted
child
growing
womb
oyster
coating
grain
sand
making
pearl
This
card
reminds
us
time
required
simply
alert
patient
waiting
The
woman
pictured
attitude
Contented
trace
anxiety
simply
waiting
Through
phases
moon
passing
overhead
remains
patient
tune
rhythms
moon
almost
become
one
She
knows
time
passive
letting
nature
take
course
But
neither
sleepy
indifferent
knows
time
ready
something
momentous
It
time
full
mystery
like
hours
dawn
It
time
thing
wait
