UNWRAPPED
Yesterday
afternoon
weeded
first
garden
tilled
soil
Now
breath
take
greater
symbol
jumping
plane
Your
fingers
touch
mine
perfect
fit
palms
together
two
breaths
finding
rhythm
Each
day
unwrapped
contents
spill
morning
afternoon
evening
I
beside
looking
forward
first
time
direction
ever
existed
