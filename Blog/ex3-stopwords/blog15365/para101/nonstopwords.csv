STREAM
OF
CONSCIOUSNESS
If
I
could
quiet
thoughts
wrap
bundle
soft
warm
crib
naps
watching
stars
would
unknown
make
little
less
obvious
All
day
I
beyond
behind
wonder
knowing
pretending
bliss
gift
lack
commitment
I
far
removed
soon
confused
I
missing
missing
Could
balance
geography
new
spot
look
map
easier
neck
Snap
around
fall
line
I
breaking
rules
still
still
enough
And
round
generation
sings
We
apologize
sacrificed
lives
hope
would
become
You
asked
us
first
capable
