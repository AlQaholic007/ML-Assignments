When
told
Noah
Ark
story
Sunday
School
I
quickly
figured
two
every
kind
animal
would
fit
one
boat
No
one
else
seemed
math
I
could
believe
ark
story
I
could
believe
sky
green
I
wanted
believe
Believing
seemed
nice
I
couldnt
I
COULD
NOT
I
felt
strange
place
everyone
else
church
seemed
believe
everything
I
kept
believing

I
thought
something
wrong
