From this assignment, initially I tried to visualize both categorical as well as non categorical variables against each other and see their impact on my prediction target namely, the price.
Initially it seemed that some of the feature would have much impact on the target.
However consider that Postcode almost related to Lattitude and Longitude,BuildingArea and Landsize share similar relations too,those were eliminated.
Many of the categorical features such as Address, SellerG,Date sold,Type and Suburb were eliminated

Initially some suburbs showed high mean price for houses such as South Metropolitan, but other suburbs showed very poor correlation with Price
Hence all of the categorical attributes were eliminated on the account of them not having major impact on the target

Features considered were:
1.Rooms
2.Landsize
3.Bathrooms
4.BuildingArea
5.Distance
6.Lattitude
7.Longtitude
8.Propertycount
